>Description</H2
><P
>      Podcasting
      is a method of publishing radio-like programs on the
      Internet.  Through podcasting, almost anyone can produce their
      own audio program, and publish episodes of it as often or as
      rarely as they like.
    </P
><P
>      To listen to podcasts, you need a program to download the
      podcast's episodes from the Internet.  Such a program is
      called a podcatcher (or sometimes a podcast aggregator).
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>hpodder</SPAN
> is this program.
    </P
><P
>      If you'd like to get going RIGHT NOW, skip on down to the
      Quick Start section.  Otherwise, let's take a look at the
      features of <SPAN

>Automatic updating of ID3 (v1 and v2) tags
            based on metadata in the podcast itself.  This important
            feature is available through iTunes but is often missed by
            other podcatchers.</P

            event of a power failure.

>Method of Operation</H3
><P
>        The basic pattern of operation with <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>hpodder</SPAN
> is to set up
        each podcast you want to receive.  Each day (or hour, or
        whatever), <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>hpodder</SPAN
> will go out and update its database by
        pulling in the latest episode lists from the podcast feed.
        Then, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>hpodder</SPAN
> will proceed to download any episodes that
        you haven't already downloaded.  After each episode is
        downloaded, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>hpodder</SPAN
> will note that fact so it isn't ever
        downloaded again.
      </P
><P
>        Let's look at this in a bit more detail.
      </P
><P
>        <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>hpodder</SPAN
> maintains two tables in a database.  One table
        lists all the podcasts you know about, as well as where the
        podcast's feed is to be downloaded from.  The feed is a file
        that the podcast's author publishes.  It lists all the
        current episodes of the podcast, and some information about
        them.  Data is added to this table with the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hpodder
          add</B
> command.
      </P
><P
>        The second table lists each episode for a given podcast,
        along with the location from which the episode can be
        downloaded and some other information about the episode
        (such as its title).  Information in this table is added by
        <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hpodder update</B
> and updated by
        <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hpodder download</B
> or 
        <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hpodder catchup</B
>.
      </P
><P
>        When you first fire up <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>hpodder</SPAN
>, it will read its
        configuration file from
        <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>~/.hpodder/hpodder.conf</TT
>.
        What happens next depends on the command.
      </P
><P
>        For <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hpodder update</B
>, the program will read
        information about all your podcasts.  It will download each
        feed.  Once it has the feed, it will look at each episode
        and compare them to the database.  If a given episode is
        already in the database, it is ignored.  Any new episodes
        are recorded in the database, and set to Pending so they
        will be downloaded on the next download run.
      </P
><P
>        For <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hpodder download</B
>, the program will
        read information about all your episodes.  For each episode
        marked Pending, the program will download the episode.  It
        will then update the episode's ID3 tags based on the podcast
        feed.  Finally, it will move the episode in-place
        atomically.  Only after all that has been done will
        <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>hpodder</SPAN
> mark the episode as Downloaded in the database.
        In this way, no episode is visible to outside tools until it
        is completely downloaded in its final form, so you can
        safely play any visible program in your download directory
        even as downloads are happening.

    </P
><P
>      To get started, simply run <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hpodder</B

      shell prompt.  <SPAN

      configuration -- which is only two questions and completely

    </P

      for your podcast, just run <B

    </P
><P

      feed you want to add.  Then run <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hpodder
        update</B
>.  If the podcast you've just added has a
      whole bunch of episodes, you may not want to download them
      all.  In that case, run <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>hpodder catchup
        <TT

>id</I

      <TT

    </P
