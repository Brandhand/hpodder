      <title>Description</title>
      <para>
        &hpodder is a program to download 
        <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast">podcast</ulink>
        episodes from the Internet.  As soch, &hpodder; is known as a
        podcatcher.
      </para>

      <refsect2 id="hpodder.features">
        <title>Feature List</title>
        <para>
          You get many unique features with &hpodder;.  Here are a
          few:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para>Convenient, easy to learn, and fast command-line
              interface (it's simple to do simple things, and
              advanced things are possible)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem><para>Automatic discovery of feed metadata such as title</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem><para>Full history database for accurate
          prevention of duplicate downloads and tracking of new episodes</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem><para>Conversion tools to convert your existing
              feed list and history from other applications to
              &hpodder;.  Supported applications and formats include:
              castpodder and ipodder.
            </para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem><para>Most operations can work fully automatically
          across your entire podcast database, or they can work
          manually as well.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

    </refsect1>

    <refsect1 id="hpodder.quickstart">
      <title>Quick Start</title>
      <para>
        This section will describe how a first-time &hpodder; user can
        get up and running quickly.  It assumes you already have
        &hpodder; compiled or installed on your system.  If not,
        please follow the instructions in the
        <filename>INSTALL</filename>
        file in the
        source distribution.
      </para>
      <para>
        To get started, simply run <command>hpodder</command> at your
        shell prompt.  &hpodder; will lead you through the first-time
        configuration -- which is only two questions and completely
        self-explanatory!
      </para>
      <para>
        After this, whenever you want to download the latest episodes
        for your podcast, just run <command>hpodder</command> again.
      </para>
      <para>
        At some point, you'll want to add more podcasts to &hpodder;.
        To do that, just run a command such as:
      </para>
      <para><command>hpodder add
      <replaceable>http://www.example.com/feed.xml</replaceable></command></para>
      <para>
        Just replace the example.com URL here with the real URL of the
        feed you want to add.  Then run <command>ipodder
        update</command>.  If the podcast you've just added has a
        whole bunch of episodes, you may not want to download them
        all.  In that case, run <command>ipodder catchup
        <replaceable>id</replaceable></command>, where
        <replaceable>id</replaceable> is the podcast number that
        ipodder gave your new podcast when you added it.
      </para>
      <para>
        Again, from here on, you can just run
        <command>ipodder</command> to download all your new episodes.
      </para>

    <refsect1 id="dfsbuild.man.options">
      <title>Options</title>
      <para>
        These are the command-line options for &dfsbuild;.  Please
        note that you must always specify at least <option>-c</option>
        and <option>-w</option>.
      </para>

        <varlistentry><term>-a <replaceable>architecture</replaceable></term>
          <listitem><para>Specify the Debian architecture of the
              destination image.  Normally, this defaults to the
              architecture of the host system.  This option may be useful

              by using this option.  Resuming is not supported from every
              point, so do not be surprised if this option doesn't work
              for you everywhere.  This option is still experimental and
              may disappear in future versions of dfsbuild.</para>

              its "work" directory.  It will create its temporary files,

            <para>It is an error if this directory already exists,
